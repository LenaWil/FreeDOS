This is FreeDOS MEM version 1.9 alpha 2 from David O'Shea.

Known issues with this version:

- on an 8086 or 80286 machine you will need to use the /NOSUMMARY (or just
  /N) command-line option to avoid a hang when EMS and/or XMS information is
  gathered
- I think that /U shows more information than it did previously; the code
  needs to be enhanced to filter out the unwanted stuff although I am not
  totally clear on what /U is meant to show and the fact that /U is short for
  "UPPER" seems confusing as it is showing conventional memory details

Notes on the source files:

- MEMTEST.C is a program that runs from the TEST directory and repeatedly
  updates the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT with the .SYS and .BAT files in
  that directory (the files to be used are listed in CASES.TXT) and after a
  reboot (which is not performed automatically) executes a series of MEM
  commands (listed in COMMANDS.TXT), redirecting their output to text files
  in the OUTPUT directory which you must create.  This program may be useful
  for quickly testing a large number of invocations of MEM, although the
  cases currently provided are not extensive.  Consider using DIFF to compare
  the output of two runs of the test cases to check the effect of your
  changes.
- NLSBIN.MAK is a Makefile fragment generated by NLSMAK.PL which is a Perl
  script.  This Makefile can be used to build MEM.EXE with different
  languages built-in.  The process of embedding the languages is based on the
  Perl script MUSCHI.PL.  The directory structure that the Makefile generates
  - NLSSRC, NLSOBJ, NLSBIN - will have major changes in the future.

The NLS files for languages other than English require translation to be done
- look for "FIXME" in those files to find the strings that require
translation.
