name: SET
de: Display or set environment variables
req: CMD_SET

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: SET [{ option }]
<LI>
EBNF: SET [{ option }] variable '=' <<string>>
</OL>

DESCRIPTION:

The first variant <FONT SIZE=-1>(without any argument)</FONT> displays
all the currently defined environment variables in the format
<FONT SIZE=-1>(without any whitespaces before or after the equal sifn)</FONT>:
EBNF: name '=' <<value>>

<P>The second variant assigns a new value
EBNF!: <<string>>
 to the specified
EBNF!: variable 
. If the
EBNF!: variable 
 already exists, the old value is overwritten without notice; otherwise
it is newly created.

STD_OPTIONS:

All options must preceed the assigment, if present.

<P><UL>
<LI><OPT>/C</OPT>: forces to keep the exact case of the letters
of the variable name; by default all letters are uppercased to
keep compatibly.
<LI><OPT>/I</OPT>: has been temporarily included to the SET command to
allow an easy way to display the current size of the environment segment,
because it is one of the most frequently reported, but not reproduceable
bug report. Once this option has been encountered, all the remaining command
line is ignored.
</UL>
