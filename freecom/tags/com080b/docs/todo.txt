Things to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fix bugs :)

Support the DOS=HIGH directive in CONFIG.SYS

Optimize the code!  For size and speed.  There are numerous places
where the code is hardly optimal for either.

^S and ^Q to pause/resume displays.

Add wildcard support to REN.

Add support for Win95 long filenames.
