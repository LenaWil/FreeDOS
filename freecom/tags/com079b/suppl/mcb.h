/* $Id$
 * $Locker$	$Name$	$State$
 *
 * header file for the MCB handling functions
 *
 * All functions work over the paragraphe number of the MCB.
 * Note: Some functions use the PSP instead of the real MCB number!
 *
 * Shells are a mess in DOS. They patch their parent field to point to
 * theirselves, thus, making correct process trees impossible.
 *
 * implemented functions:
	file		function	short desription

	mcb.h		SEG2MCB		transform a memory handle into MCB number
	mcb.h		MCB2SEG		transform a MCB number into a memory handle
	mcb_apar.c	mcb_allParents	spawn function for all parents and current PSP
	mcb_env.c	isEnv		check, if MCB is an environment segment
	mcb_is.c	isMCB		check, if MCB is a valid MCB number
	mcb_leng.c	mcb_length	return the length of the *memory handle* in bytes
	mcb_mstr.c	mcb_primaryShell	return the MCB of the primary shell
	mcb_nxt.c	nxtMCB		return the MCB number of the next MCB in the chain
	mcb_owne.c	mcb_owner	return the MCB number of the owner process
	mcb_pare.c	mcb_shell	return the MCB number of the shell of mcb
	mcb_psp.c	isPSP		check, if MCB is a valid process (PSP)
	mcb_shell.c	isShell		check, if MCB is a shell process
	mcb_toen.c	mcb_toenv	transform the MCB number in the env seg, if PSP
	mcb_walk.c	mcb_walk	spawn a function for each valid MCB
