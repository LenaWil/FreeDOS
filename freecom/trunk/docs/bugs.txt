+ When switching to a drive with no disk in it, it doesn't notice, and
you get garbage.

+ Pipes, e.g. "cmd1 | cmd2", are substituted by a similiar instruction
sequence as follows:
	cmd1 >%TEMPFILE%
	cmd2 <%TEMPFILE%
	DEL %TEMPFILE%
Because the temporary file is closed between statement #1 and #2, there
is the Potential Problem some other process had deleted or opened
the temporary file, thus, denying to re-open it in statement #2.
Please read DOCS\PIPING.TXT.

From: Steffen
 o in FOR command redirects are lost.

From: John P. Price
 o History.  If you typed a long command line (one that wraps to the
   next line), then if you go back and forth with the up and down
   keys, it scrolls the screen in a weird way.

 o command.com uses too much memory!

 o make filename completion search for exe and com files that match if
   you press tab while typing the first word (the command).  Make
   this a compile-time option.
