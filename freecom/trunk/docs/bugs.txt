From: Steffen
 o in FOR command redirects are lost.

From: John P. Price
 o History.  If you typed a long command line (one that wraps to the
   next line), then if you go back and forth with the up and down
   keys, it scrolls the screen in a weird way.

 o command.com uses too much memory!

 o make filename completion search for exe and com files that match if
   you press tab while typing the first word (the command).  Make
   this a compile-time option.
