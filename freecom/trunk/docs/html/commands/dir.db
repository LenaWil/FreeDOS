name: dir
de: Displays the contents of the directory
see: mkdir, rmdir, chdir
req: CMD_DIR

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: DIR [{ options | pattern }]

<P><CMD>DIR</CMD> displays the contents of direcories and/or
the attributes of files, whatever the <ARG>pattern</ARG> specifies.
If no <ARG>pattern</ARG> is specified on command line, the current
working directory is displayed. The actual information displayed
depends on the specified options and is explained below.
<P>A <ARG>pattern</ARG> may contain <A HREF="!:wildcards">wildcards</A>,
which are expanded against both files and directories. To specify a
directory is essentially equal to write: <CMD>directory\*.*<CMD>.
<P>Unlike options patterns are performed in sequence, that means that
if two patterns are specified, first all entries matching the first one,
then all entries matching the second one are displayed;
<FONT SIZE=-1>instead of to display the matching entries intermixed</FONT>.

STD_OPTIONS:
<UL>
<LI><OPT>/A</OPT>: (All) Wildcards are matched against System and Hidden
files, too.
<LI><OPT>/B</OPT>: (Bare) Displays the lines with the information of
files and directories only. The ones displaying the volume label,
the serial number, totals etc. are suppressed. In combination with
<OPT>/S</OPT> the absolute path of the files is displayed.
<LI><OPT>/L</OPT>: (Lower-case) Filenames are displayed in lower-case
letters rather than capitol ones.
<LI><OPT>/P</OPT>: (Page) Page the output -- pause the display after
	issuing one screen-full.
<LI><OPT>/S</OPT>: (Subdirectories) Recursively display directories.
<LI><OPT>/W</OPT>: (Wide) Displays five filenames per line and suppress
the information about the file size, date etc.
</UL>

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1

CMD: DIR
Displays the contents of the current directory, but ignore System and
Hidden files. The output may look like this:

<PRE>
!!todo!!
</PRE>

EXAMPLE: 2

CMD: DIR a* bb* *.txt
First displays all files, that begin with the letter <CMD>A</CMD>; then
all files, that begin with two letters <CMD>B</CMD>, are displayed and
at last all files with the extension <CMD>TXT</CMD>.

EXAMPLE: 3

CMD: DIR /w a* b*
CMD: DIR a* /w b*
CMD: DIR a* b* /w
Because the position of options is not significant,
all these examples behave the same way and display the matching files
in <EM>wide</EM> or also called <EM>short</EM> form, which may look
like this:

<PRE>
!!todo!!
</PRE>

EXAMPLE: 4

CMD: DIR /as ..
CMD: DIR .. /a/s
CMD: DIR /s .. /a
Because <CMD>DIR</CMD> processes all options globally and single-character
options may be joined together, all the above examples behave the same way
and recursively display all files beginning from the current directory's
parent directory including all System and Hidden files.
