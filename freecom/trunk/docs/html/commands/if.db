name: IF
de: Conditional execution of a command

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] EXIST file <<command>>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] ERRORLEVEL number <<command>>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] string '==' word <<command>>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] quoted-string '==' quoted-string <<command>>
</OL>

Conditionally executes the specified
EBNF!: <<command>>
. If the keyword
EBNF!: NOT
 is specified, the condition is negated, meaning, the
EBNF!: <<command>>
 is executed, if the condition evaluates to false.

<P>The first condition evaluates to true, if the specified <ARG>file</ARG>
exists. Wildcards are supported. On local file systems one can test for
character devices, too.

<P>The second variant evaluates to true, if the errorlevel is currently
assigned to a number greater or equal than the specified <ARG>number</ARG>.
Errorlevels are assigned when external commands terminates or via
CANCEL or QUIT.

<P>The third and four ones are true, when the left string is case-sensitively
equal to the string on the right side of the double equal sign.
Either side may be quoted by double quotes, though, if the right side
is <EM>not</EM> quoted, the first word is tested only.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: IF NOT EXIST c:\command.com ECHO There is no COMMAND.COM in C:\
<BR>Executes the ECHO command, if a file <CMD>C:\COMMAND.COM</CMD>
does <EM>not</EM> exist.

EXAMPLE: 2
CMD: IF EXIST c:\fdos\nul GOTO have_fdos_directory
<BR>Branch the interpretation of the batch script to the label, if
the file <CMD>C:\FDOS\NUL</CMD> exists. Because the filename <CMD>NUL</CMD>
corresponds to the character device <CMD>NUL:</CMD>, which always exists,
this test may be used to probe for the existance of the path
<CMD>C:\FDOS</CMD>, because all character devices are virtually present in
every directory of local filesystems.

EXAMPLE: 3
CMD: IF %1==name ECHO First argument is "name"
<BR>ECHO is executed, if the first argument of the current batch script
is <ARG>"name"</ARG> (without the quotes). <CMD>%1</CMD> may expand to
any string, even with embedded whitespaces, but without an embedded
double equal sign. Also, metacharacters included within the argument
are evaluated.

EXAMPLE: 4
CMD: IF "%1"=="first name" ECHO First argument is "first name"
<BR>ECHO is executed, if the first argument of the current batch script
is <ARG>"first name"</ARG> (without the quotes). <CMD>%1</CMD> may expand
to any string, even with embedded whitespaces or an embedded double
equal sign or metacharacters.
