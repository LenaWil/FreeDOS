SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: CALL program [ <<arguments>> ]
<LI>
EBNF: CALL [ /S | /N ] program [ <<arguments>> ]
</OL>

DESCRIPTION:

Calls a program or batch script.

<P>If the <ARG>program</ARG> is a <A HREF="!:batch">batch script</A>,
that means it has the
extension <CMD>.BAT</CMD>, <CMD>CALL</CMD> nests the batch script within
the already running one. Without <CMD>CALL</CMD> the invoked batch
script would terminate all already running batch scripts.
<P>If present, the arguments are passed unchanged to the invoked program.

STD_OPTIONS:
<UL>
<LI><OPT>/S</OPT>: If <ARG>program</ARG> is not a batch script, the external
program is executed by swapping FreeCOM out of memory. This process will
require more time, especially if FreeCOM is to be reloaded from a floppy,
some internal settings are lost, e.g. command line history, but it will
free as much memory as possible for the external program.
<P>This option and, thereby, this function is available only, if FreeCOM
had been compiled with some support for swapping.

<LI><OPT>/N</OPT>: If <ARG>program</ARG> is not a batch script, the external
program is executed directly, with swapping disabled. <OPT>/N</OPT> superceeds
<OPT>/S</OPT>.
</UL>

<P>Note: In the future to swap FreeCOM out of memory during the execution
of an external program will be the default behaviour.
