 *
 * header file for the environment handling functions
 *
 * All functions work over the process-local environment segment, thus,
 * allowing external (spawned) processes to alter the environment and to
 * use this environment as a template for the exec() system call.
 * The functions leave the additional strings at the end of the environment
 * segment intact.
 * The functions detect a moved or deleted environment segment, if this
 * acting is reflected by the PSP fields.
 * NO function upper-case the variable name. That's different to
 * common DOS implementations.
 *
 * The environment segment must be a stand-alone segment allocated with
 * the DOS API function "Allocate Memory", DOS-48. The standard environment
 * is of that type.
 *
 * The low-level functions suppose, that no process accesses the
 * environment segment asynchronously (TSR, or device driver).
 *
 *	Implemented functions:
