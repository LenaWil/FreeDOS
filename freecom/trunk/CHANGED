	expects that the string area of an environment is used and is
	therefore killed. FreeCOM now zeroes the string counter
	in order to let SUPPL work correctly.
	Warning: Known Bug: Now test is made, if the two bytes for the
	counter is not available, thus, the env_nullStrings() function
	fails.
