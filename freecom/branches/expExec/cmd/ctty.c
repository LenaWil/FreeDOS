/*
 *  CTTY.C - ctty command.
 *
 *  Current possible problems: -- 2000/01/14 ska
 *
 *  Problem: Only the first three handles are changed to the passed device.
 *  -->
 *  As far as I know to CTTY (Change TTY) it is not sufficient just to
 *  change the handles 0-2 (stdin, stdout, stderr), but one must inform
 *  the system that another driver is the default STDIN/OUT device,
 *  what would include to:
 *  + return ienabled STDIN/STDOUT bits when the device attributes are
 *    retreived via IOCTL,
 *  + change the pointer at LoL+0C.
 *  My original implication that INT-29 is effected, too, is wrong in
 *  the Win98 DOSbox.
 *
 *  FreeDOS kernel 2017f passes the DOS1-compatible IO functions to
 *  the handle based ones, so maybe most simply programs will work?!
