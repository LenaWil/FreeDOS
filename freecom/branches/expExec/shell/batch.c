/*
 *  BATCH.C - batch file processor for COMMAND.COM.
 *
 *	Enter a batch file
 *
 *	Say: BATCH.BAT arg1 arg2 ...
 *
 *	The filename of the script itself is internally storred in its
 *	absolute form, so that CHDIR'ing and switching the current drive
 *	won't effect the script when continueing.
 *
 *	The arguments expands to:
 *		argv[0] == name of batch script as written on command line
 *		argv[1..N] == argument
 *	Arguments are delimited by the usual argument separators, such as
 *	whitespaces, but quotes are honored. When expanding quotes are
 *	restored in the same fashion as they had been written on command
 *	line, but most internal commands do ignore missing or embedded quotes.
 *
 *	Switching floppies however must be supported, e.g.:
 *	There is a INSTALL.BAT on disk #1, and there is a sequence like this:
 *	01: COPY *.* c:\fdos
 *	02: :disk2
 *	03: pause Please insert disk #2
 *	04: if not exist \diskid.2 goto disk2
 *	05: copy *.* c:\fdos
 *
 *	If there is an INSTALL.BAT script with exactly the same contents on
 *	disk #2, the execution of the script continues without problem, when
 *	the floppy gets changed within the PAUSE statement in line #03, with
 *	the lines #04 and following.
 *
 *	During execution of commands, the file is closed and to read the next
 *	one the file gets re-opened. Doing so also supports so-called self-
 *	modifying batch script, where a script modifies itself; a process that
 *	a) might be denied if SHARE or a similiar functionality has been
 *		activated, or
 *	b) because of pre-fetching and other buffering methods is not reflected
 *		at once during the batch file processing.
