Things to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fix bugs :)

Support the DOS=HIGH directive in CONFIG.SYS

Optimize the code!  For size and speed.  There are numerous places
where the code is hardly optimal for either.

Swap out when exec'ing? YES! Unless running from a floppy?

^S and ^Q to pause/resume displays.

Add wildcard support to REN.

Add support for Win95 long filenames.

Make the permanent command.com (/p) store the messages in memory
(this is already implemented) and have some way for other instances
of command.com to use these same messages in memory.  Maybe the
Multiplexor interrupt (2Fh)?  Does command.com have a MSDOS reserved
mux handler number?
