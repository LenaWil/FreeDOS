Compile notes:

1) Setup TC++ v1.01 (see www.freedos.org, Links page for a reference to
Borland's museum site).
2) Configure CONFIG.MAK (see below)
3) Configure CONFIG.H   (see there)
4) Run MAKE -fcommand.mak
(Some newer MAKE variants may require a space between the -f option
 and the makefile name.)

You will find two executables in the FreeCOM directory:
COMMAND.EXE and COMMAND.COM.
The .COM file is the stand-alone application, which includes the
strings etc, whereas COMMAND.EXE is the pure executable without the
strings table for instance. For debugging you must use the .EXE
file.


CONFIG.MAK

CC_BASE_PATH
base path (aka "root") of Turbo C++ v1.01, usually it is sufficient to
modify this macro and all files (headers and libraries) and programs
(C compiler and linker) will be found. If not, check the macros at the
end of the file and/or the useage of $(LIBPATH) within COMMAND.MAK or
FIXSTRS.MAK respectively.

SUPPL_INC_PATH / SUPPL_LIB_PATH
To compile this version of command.com, you have to add the SUPPL library.
SUPPL_INC_PATH points to the directory with all the header files, whereas
SUPPL_LIB_PATH contains the pre-compiled library (SUPPL_S.LIB). If you
have downloaded SUPPL.ZIP from:
ftp://freedos.sourceforge.net/pub/freedos/freecom/suppl.zip

and if you have extracted the contents into the FreeCOM directory,
the default values (.\SUPPL) are OK.
