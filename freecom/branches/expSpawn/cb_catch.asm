	^Break signal catcher and initialization function.

	It performs two tasks:
		1) If the current process is the same as the one the init
		function has called, only ctrlBreak is set to 1 (one)
		and the ^Break is ignored furtherly.
		2) Otherwise, the process is terminated.

	See the comments of the definitions of DEBUG and LOCAL_PID.

	Note: TASM maintains "@Model" as a numerical representation of the
		memory model, "1" == "Tiny". I don't know, if it is portable,
		but the "SEG _psp" generates a reference EXE2COM cannot
		resolve.
