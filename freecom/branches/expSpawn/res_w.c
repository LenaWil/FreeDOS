/*
 *  RES_W.C - Write resource
 *
 *	Contains all functions to encapsule to "write" resources.
 *
 *	startResource(FILE *f, res_majorid_t , res_minorid_t)
 *		Starts a new resource and issues the necessary prologue.
 *		All the data should be dumped immediately now.
 *
 *	endResource(FILE *f)
 *		ends the resource and write the necessary epilogue. The
 *		should be called when all data has been dumped; when the function
 *		returns the file is positioned immediately behind the last byte
 *		allocated by the resource.
 *
 *
 *	Both functions must be called in sequence, that means first
 *	startResource(), then endResource(), but no intermixing or
 *	end() before start().
