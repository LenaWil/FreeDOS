Compile notes:

To compile this version of command.com, you have to add the suppl
directory to your list of include directories so that the compiler
can find the header files located there.

The library suppl_s.lib was built with the suppl library version 2.6
which had the dosalloc.c file modified to fix a problem with the
FreeDOS kernel.
