; A rudimentary COUNTRY.SYS for FreeDOS
; Handles only Date/Time/Currency, and NOT codepage things [yet]
; Compatible with COUNTRY.SYS of MS-DOS, PC-DOS, PTS-DOS, OS/2, Win9x, WinNT
; File format described in RBIL tables 2619-2622
;
; Created as a kernel table by Tom Ehlert
; Reformatted and commented by Bernd Blaauw
; Separated from the kernel by Luchezar Georgiev
; Amended by many contributors (see names below)
