Ready to install the FreeDOS software?  You should have already
created your install floppies, or dumped all the install files into a
single directory on your hard disk.

Floppy access is still a little slow.  If you are installing this
from a boot floppy using FreeDOS, then you will find that the install
process is a little longer than you expect.  FreeDOS works fine once
you boot from the hard disk, though.
