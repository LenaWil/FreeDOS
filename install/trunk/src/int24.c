/* int24 -- READ.ME
Enclosed find int24.c. This is a source code file for Turbo-C
that allows you to write your own "critical event handler". The
critical event handler is the code in DOS which prints the message
"Disk Error, (A)bort (R)etry (F)ail"... and gets a keystroke from
the user to decide what to do. This tends to mess up people's pretty
screens so it is nice to catch it. You might even disallow aborting, if
you don't wan't to let people abort the program.

The only thing to keep in mind is that you CANNOT call any DOS routines
in the handler, because DOS is not reentrant.

This file is provided on an as-is basis. It is public domain and I make
no claims whatsoever as to what it actually does :-) Hopefully it will
prove useful to PC programmers.

Let me know if you find any bugs...

Note: There was an earlier version of this floating around that calls
the TC function bioskey(). I got rid of that because bioskey in turn
calls DOS which is not allowed (and often hangs the computer) in
interrupt handlers.

/** int24.c
 **
 ** Interrupt 24 Handler version 0.9
 **
 ** When DOS has trouble accessing a peripheral it
 ** calls Interrupt 0x24. This is usually a pointer to
 ** the code in COMMAND.COM that prints the "Abort, Retry,
 ** Ignore" message. This is a completely portable module
 ** that replaces that message with a slightly more aesthetic
 ** one.
 **
 ** To use it, just call install_24(). To restore the DOS
 ** handler, call uninstall_24(). Warning! If you ever go
 ** into graphics mode of some sort, uninstall this! It won't
 ** be able to deal with a graphics screen correctly.
 **
 ** Note: We don't let the user ignore the error, which they shouldn't
 ** be doing anyway.
 **
 ** HISTORY
 ** -------
 ** 19 Mar 90	Created JS
 ** 16 Apr 90   Fixed to eliminate call to bioskey, which was reentering DOS
