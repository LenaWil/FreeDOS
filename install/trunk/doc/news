This file lists the changes since the FreeDOS Install program was
moved into CVS on SourceForge (see http://freedos.sourceforge.net):


3.7 - major cleanup of interface, some cleanup of code.  Now uses
  select_yn instead of getch_yn to grab yes/no responses from the
  user.  This should be better for internationalization, although I
  don't grab "Yes" and "No" from the catalog yet.
