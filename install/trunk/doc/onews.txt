Changes to the FreeDOS Install program:

Copyright (C) Jim Hall <jhall@freedos.org>


3.7.7 (VER_3_7_7) - Added a Swedish translation of the Install
  program, by Martin Stromberg.  [Aug 15, 2002]

3.7.6 (VER_3_7_6) - critical error fixes.  Jeremy Davis is now the
 maintainer.

3.7.5 (VER_3_7_5a) - changes by Jeremy Davis to fix bug introduced by
 previous changes: install.c and inst.c would indicate failure to
 allocate memory instead of correctly indicating error reading dat
 file.  Minor cleanup.

3.7.4 (VER_3_7_4) - Jeremy Davis has again fixed more bugs and added
 extra patches.  Fixed in this release: minor changes to the NLS files
 to remove the y/n prompt, updates to dat.c to support dynamic sizing
 of the dat array, additional code to make Install portable across
 compilers.

3.7.3 (VER_3_7_3) - Changes by Jeremy Davis to better support '/'
 instead of '-' for DOS option characters.  Really, this should use
 getopt, but that is next on the list.  Haven't had the chance to
 test-build this before the release, so I hope it works!  -jh

3.7.2 (VER_3_7_2) - Jeremy Davis (jeremyd@computer.org) has fixed some bugs.
 Version 3.7.2 includes those fixes.  Specifically:

3.7.1a
Modified so all text messages now in catalog (no hard coded ones)
  That is, all text messages (not filenames) are now in single header file,
  text.h, which provides defines for the text and catalog numbers, and 
  all references to any text message (including some error messages) use
  these defines and go through cats.
Bug 653 - [yn] removed from english & hard coded prompts - TODO other langs
          also uses the patch to cats that supports \n and other
          C escape codes in the message catalogs
Bug 611 - Yes To All for packages when installing a disk (applies only to
          current disk, not whole disk set)
Bug  31 - added /mono switch to use BLACK & LIGHTGRAY instead of BLUE & WHITE
          currently getopt is not used, simple string compare since it is the
          only option, I plan to work on bug 8 and add more command line
          options, so will probably change to use improved version of getopt.
Bug  67 - added prompt showing user specified install to/from dirs and 
          question user if correct (if user answers no, then will forget
          their current specified directories and let them re-enter them)
Modified some of the makefile.bc files.  This archive should contain everything
  except unzip, which should be placed in LIB\UNZIP, note makefile previously
  in LIB\UNZIP\MSDOS used and updated copy of unzip's makefile.bc, which is
  now in LIB\UNZIP (so when installing on DOS with Borland C/C++ then don't
  have to do anything other than unzip the Unzip archive then from main
  directory run make -f makefile.bc, and all libs and source built as before).

3.7.1b
Bug   8 - added -src -dst and -nopause options (changed /more to -more) to 
          support automatic installs (ie no prompting or only partial prompts)
Bug  66 - after directory specified, we now ensure the path exists by creating
          it if it does not [ no error checking is done, as it attempts to
          create path even if it already exists which should fail silently ]
          A future approach could actually test if valid dir, if not prompt
          the user should we create it.
Bug 609 - Install now attempts to read *.%lang%, failing that tries *.TXT, then *
          A future approach/enhancement maybe to try a directory, ie either
          %lang%\*.TXT or possibly %NLSPATH%\%lang%\*.TXT or %NLSPATH%\*.%lang%
Modified install.c so if TZ not set, assumes GMT0 so unzip gives no warnings.

May 08, 2001


3.7.1c
Bug   5 - added support for a log file, the file is both user readable, and in
          a format that can be used to repeat an install (requires external program).
          The file is <dst path>\INSTALL.LOG, to use for repeat install, backup
          <src path>\INSTALL.DAT, then MKRPINST.EXE INSTALL.LOG, this generates
          an INSTALL.DAT and series of <disk>.# files, all with either Y or N
          as done in the install and INST.BAT.  The INSTALL.DAT and <disk>.#
          files can be used as replacements for ones in the disk sets, and
          INST.BAT can be used instead of INSTALL.EXE to execute INSTALL.EXE with
          the -dst, -src, and -nopause options allow for automated repeat installations
          from the same source to same destination.
TODO      write MKRPINST.EXE
Added 1 line to dat.c so INSTALL.DAT may have comments (if 1st character is a #),
          and ignores empty lines
Removed getopt.c as not currently used.  Should getopt be used in the future,
          I recommond using the getopt [.c, .h, 1.c] from isapnptools, as its
          version supports short and long options and is meant largely for DOS
          (DJGPP and BC) compatibility with Linux's glibc getopt.
Fixed where I forgot to change repaint.c to also use the message catalog strings.

3.7.1d
Bug 610 - changed so if does not find <disk>.1 will prompt for 1st disk
Bug 608 - modified getkey() so checks for Ctrl-C and signal via raise(SIGINT),
          which under borland at least, results in normal Ctrl-C handler (INT 23)
          being called.  Added signal handler for SIGINT that closes all open
          files, displays an error message, and exits. Possible future enhancement
          would be to save the screen, prompt asking user if sure, if not then
          restore screen and continue, otherwise exit with message.
Modified pause routine to call getkey() instead of getch() directly

May 10, 2001


3.7.1e
Changed default behavior to log, so now switch is -nolog to disable logging.
Now when control-c is pressed user is prompted to see if they really want to abort.
Created MKRPINST.EXE (see above) and MAUTOCFG.EXE (reads the log file and creates
           an appropriate autoexec.bat and config.sys file, possibly useful 
           for bug 612).  [also a testlog.c just as a demo/test app]. 
           Placed in SRC\EXTRA\
TODO - test/fix so can once again compile under Linux.
May 11, 2001


3.7.1f
Modified cat_file so does a better search for localized file.  Also made it so
           so can be compiled independently (allowing for batch files to 
           automatically print localized text file if LANG set).
Fixed minor bug in Cats library.  The search alg used nlspath instead of tok,
           so only the 1st component of %NLSPATH% was ever used for that 
           part of search. [The included version of cats now corresponds to
           cats393b.zip from http://www.darklogic.org/internationalization/ 
           except catpath.h is moved from lib/ to include/ .]
Fixed so after calling unzip restores our pretty SIGINT handler.
The install.exe in sample is compressed with upx --8086 --best
May 12, 2001


3.7.1g
Corrected cat.c to actually return -1 when failed to open file (used to return 0,
            but I changed to return -1, except I initially forget to make the change).
            Changed it to not prepend .\, so can actually specify paths such as \filename
Updated INSTALL.TXT and HELP
All included .EXE files are packed with UPX (using --best and --8086)

___________

3.7.1 (VER_3_7_1) - Added a Hungarian translation of the Install
  program, by Nagy Daniel.

3.7 (VER_3_7) - major cleanup of interface, some cleanup of code.  Now
  uses select_yn instead of getch_yn to grab yes/no responses from the
  user.  This should be better for internationalization, although I
  don't grab "Yes" and "No" from the catalog yet.
  ** now in CVS on SourceForge

3.62 - Maxime Vincent <max.vincent@skynet.be> has provided a fix to
 the French language file, and a new NL (Dutch) file.

3.61 - We've taken the FreeDOS install program out of CVS, since I now
  do all the development on DOS (not under UNIX.)  In 3.61, Ilya
  Vasilyev has provided a Russian translation.

3.6 - A few changes made, the most notable being that I
  removed the need for its own lib/conio library (under UNIX).  This
  has been separated from the FreeDOS Install program, and is now its
  own UNIX library called 'libconio'.  New install.fr translation.
  Updated install.de file.

3.5c - New install.pt translation by Luiz Passarelli
<luizp@sti.com.br>.  New install.it translation by Alessio Palma
<kht@iol.it>

3.5b - New install.es file from Altair
<aitor.sm@teleline.es>

3.5a - New install.de file from Karsten Hilbert
<Karsten.Hilbert@gmx.net>

3.5 - Adds international support using UNIX-like catopen/catgets.

3.2b - Used _makepath() instead of using sprintf() to build
my paths by hand.  This is cleaner for Borland C.  This also fixes a
bug for me where the install program would barf (under DOS) if you
gave it a Dest Dir or Source Dir that contained a trailing backslash.
_makepath() handles the trailing backslash just fine.

3.2a - Added a bar graph to inst.c. Fixes for building on
FreeDOS.  Works great.

3.141 - Version "pi".  Minor hack to clean up a forgotten
curses refresh().  Removed it from DOS using '#ifdef'.

3.14 - More cleanup for the UI.  I hope I'm making this
easier to use.  Complaints about the interface and what the user is
supposed to do next are my top two complaints.  Also made a hack so
that tabs in TXT and LSM files are displayed as a row of blank space
(tabs were being displayed as a small circle, which is ASCII 09h.)

3.13 - Cleaned up the UI quite a bit, and made the error
messages more clear.  Fixed a few bugs that were reported on
http://www.freedos.org/bugs/

3.12 - Where the program is expecting a y/n response, the
program now only accepts 'y' or 'n', case insensitive.  This was done
by adding getch_yn(), and calling it in place of getch() where needed.

3.11 - Added code to set the background to blue and the
foreground to white, and to re-set the console colors back to the
user's default colors when the program ends.

3.1 - Major code cleanup to the Install program.  Basically
re-wrote the entire install.c file, and re-worked the sources to use
conio instead of curses.  This should make for faster execution on
DOS, at the expense of slower execution (due to conio emulation
through curses) on UNIX.  Dropped the `thecurse' compatibility library
(provided curses emulation through conio) because it is no longer
needed.  Program now uses .LSM files only for the description files.
If you want to use another format, write your own.  Standardized the
printed strings so that it will be easier to migrate to MSGLIB for
internationization.  Due to the significant changes in the source
tree, I moved all development to a new CVS project.

3.0 - adds a curses-style interface.

2.2 - Added support for LSM files.  Also generally cleaned
up the code.  Removed the "Extractor List" functionality, since we are
all using zip files now.  The INSTALL.TXT has been replaced with
individual series.TXT files.  All .TXT files are plain text files.

2.1 - added support for Debian description files

2.0 - Incorporates the Unzip code into the source tree, so I
don't need to use system().  Note that the Unzip code IS NOT INCLUDED
in this source tree - you need to download it separately and compile
UNZIP.LIB using the LIB\UNZIP\MSDOS\MAKEFILE.BC file (for Borland C.)
Also added support for Red Hat Package Header files (.rph files) to
print the description.

1.2.1 - Added the proper files to support the FreeDOS
"Orlando" distribution.

1.2 - If the install program gets a fatal error (can't find
UNZIP) then it will quit immediately with a message to that effect.
Also will display an OEM.TXT file at the beginning.  Checks return
codes for the system() function call on unzip.  Counts non-fatal
errors, and report them at the end.  Checks for next disk number file
before it looks for the Endfile.

1.1 - Fixed a bug where entries from the TXT file are not
printed if the case does not match.

1.0 - First release of the Install program.  Uses a call to
system() to extract the packages using 'unzip'.  Requires that the
install.exe program be in the same directory as install.txt and
install.dat.
