Changes to the Free-DOS Install program:

Copyright (C) James Hall <jhall1@isd.net>

3.0 (VER_3_0) - adds a curses-style interface.

2.2 (VER_2_2) - Added support for LSM files.  Also generally cleaned
up the code.  Removed the "Extractor List" functionality, since we are
all using zip files now.  The INSTALL.TXT has been replaced with
individual series.TXT files.  All .TXT files are plain text files.

2.1 (VER_2_1) added support for Debian description files

2.0 (VER_2_0) - Incorporates the Unzip code into the source tree, so I
don't need to use system().  Note that the Unzip code IS NOT INCLUDED
in this source tree - you need to download it separately and compile
UNZIP.LIB using the LIB\UNZIP\MSDOS\MAKEFILE.BC file (for Borland C.)
Also added support for Red Hat Package Header files (.rph files) to
print the description.

1.2.1 (VER_1_2_1) - Added the proper files to support the FreeDOS
"Orlando" distribution.

1.2 (VER_1_2) - If the install program gets a fatal error (can't find
UNZIP) then it will quit immediately with a message to that effect.
Also will display an OEM.TXT file at the beginning.  Checks return
codes for the system() function call on unzip.  Counts non-fatal
errors, and report them at the end.  Checks for next disk number file
before it looks for the Endfile.

1.1 (VER_1_1) - Fixed a bug where entries from the TXT file are not
printed if the case does not match.

1.0 (VER_1_0) - First release of the Install program.  Uses a call to
system() to extract the packages using 'unzip'.  Requires that the
install.exe program be in the same directory as install.txt and
install.dat.


Upcoming changes:

4.0 - Will add better package management.
