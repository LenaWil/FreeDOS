KNOWN BUGS OR "TO DO" ITEMS:

* Need to clear the keyboard buffer when calling yesno(), otherwise
  what you answer for "do you want to install everything" seems to be
  what you get for "do you want to install source".

* Need to remove the use of hard-coded values in install.c. Prefer to
  look in PACKAGES\*\*.ZIP instead, but this will require updating the
  install.c code to use a different method to just look for BASE when
  you don't want to install everything.

* When switch to using PACKAGES\*\*.ZIP, we'll need a good way to
  inform the user when they ask to install everything and only BASE
  exists, or if nothing exists when you ask to install just
  BASE. Currently, it silently skips any directories where it cannot
  do a readdir().

* Would like to add a "beep" when it's done installing.

* Needs better error checking.

* Prefer to use UzpMain() directly from pkginst.c rather than
  system(), but there's a bug in calling UzpMain() from the Install
  program. I can't find it. If anyone can help me track this down,
  I'll buy you a beer.

* NOTE: pkginstall() was written to be a "wrapper" to whatever we use
  to extract FreeDOS package files. Right now, we use ZIP files, but
  later we might use RPM or DEB files, whatever.

* If using UzpMain() or calling UNZIP.EXE, should probably set TZ if
  not already set, so the Unzip library doesn't complain. Currently,
  this is "fixed" by using a dummy UNZIP.EXE that sets TZ before
  calling UzpMain().

* OpenWatcom's system() always seems to return 0 (ok) even if failed?

* Need to fix up the buf[] allocation in install.c for prompting the
  install destination path. Kind of kludgy right now, but works.

* Should display the install destination path in all uppercase, so it
  looks like a regular DOS path.

* Should validate that the install destination path exists (or can be
  created) and is a valid DOS path. Do this before attempting the rest
  of the install.

* Some screen user interface cleanup. Mostly, I think this is
  rearranging where the prompts are located on the screen.

* Add NLS (Kitten) support.

* Normalize the program strings, to re-use as much as possible from
  the previous NLS effort.
