To compile UNZIP.LIB for the FreeDOS Install program:

1. Download the sources to InfoZip's Unzip. This is known to work
   with Unzip 552. You can get it from:

    ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/src/

2. Extract the Unzip sources. You can do this under the source tree
   for Install, if you like.

3. Copy the MAKEFILE and UNZIP.LST into the Unzip source tree.

4. Go to the Unzip source tree, and type:

   wmake unzip.lib

5. That's it.
