================================
For UnZip 6.0/6.1/who knows:
================================

   o add multi-part zipfile handling

	top of the list!

   o rewrite to use fread/fseek/etc.  [eventually: test
     write(bytes) vs. fwrite(words), especially on Crays/Alphas]

	soon (in conjunction with multi-part handling, probably)

   o incorporate new backfill version of inflate()

	wait for zlib version

   o check NEXTBYTE for EOF in crypt.c, funzip.c and explode.c, too

	soon

   o use (simple!) configure script in combination with Unix Makefile

	someday

   o add option to force completely non-interactive operation (no queries
     for overwrite/rename, password, etc.); also allow some sort of non-
     interactive password provision?  (file? command-line? env. variable?)

	someday?

   o add testing of extra fields (if have CRC)

	later

   o rewrite to allow use as a filter

	way, way later...

   o add option to search zipfile contents for a string and print the
     results? ("zipgrep" option--e.g., unzip -g or unzip -S) (easy for
     fixed strings, hard for wildcards/true regex's)

	way, way later, if at all...probably use libregex

   o add -y "display symlinks" option to zipinfo?  various sorting options?
     (-St date/time, -Sn name)?

	who knows

   o add "in-depth" option to zipinfo? (check local headers against
     central, etc.)--make it a better debugging tool (or just create
     zipfix)

	who knows (zip -F, -FF already exist)


=======================================

   o miscellaneous little stuff:  whenever
     --------------------------

 - decide whether to use WinGUI "skipping" diagnostics in extract.c
 - combine "y/n/A/N" query/response stuff into unified section with query
    function(s) (InputFn?)
 - disable ^V code in remain mapname() routines

 - change DOS -f/-u stuff to use DOS API for getting filetimes, not stat()

 - add (-N?) option to lose all user input and/or switch to "(*input)()"
   function, replaceable by UzpAltMain() param
 - add -@ option to read from stdin (zip) or from file (PKZIP)?  (go32 built-in)
 - add -oo option to overwrite OS/2 and DOS system and hidden files, too
 - add option to compute MD5 checksum on files and/or on entire zipfile?

 - change filename-matching logic so case-insensitive if case-sensitive fails?

 - allow multiple dir creation with -d option? [Bob Maynard]

 - use gcc -pg, gprof to do profiling on unzip

Features from old BUGS file (mostly duplicates of other entries above):

 - ignore case for internal filename match on non-Unix systems, unless file-
    specs enclosed in single quotes
 - modify to decompress input stream if part of a pipe, but continue using
    central directory if not (BIG job!)--extended local header capability
 - add zipinfo option(s) to sort alphabetically, by date/time, in reverse, etc.
 - when listing filenames, use '?' for non-printables? [Thomas Wolff, 92.6.1]
 - add zipinfo "in-depth" option? (check local vs. central filenames, etc.)
 - create zipcat program to concatenate zipfiles
 - add -oo option (overwrite and override)?  no user queries (if bad password,
    skip file; if disk full, take default action; if VMS special on non-VMS,
    unpack anyway; etc.)
 - add -Q[Q[Q]] option (quiet mode on comments, cautions, warnings and errors)?
    forget -oo, or make synonym?  Default level -Q?
 - add OS/2 .INF format helpfiles for UnZip and ZipInfo?
