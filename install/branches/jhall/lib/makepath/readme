This is the README for the _makepath() library of functions.

The library will include calls for _makepath(), _splitpath(), and
_fullpath(), all of which are functions provided by Borland C (DOS).

Actually, _fullpath() is not done yet.  I probably won't finish it up
until I need it.

The _makepath() library of functions is intended as a compatibility
library for UNIX, so that you can compile DOS programs that use
_makepath() on UNIX systems.
