How to compile the FreeDOS Install program:

** Things you will need to compile the FreeDOS Install program:

   - Info-Unzip source code
   - Cats library (supports UNIX-like catopen/catgets)

______________________________________________________________________

TO COMPILE THE INSTALL PROGRAM:

0. Compile the cats.lib library for your system.

1. Unzip the sources (you've already done that if you are reading this
   file)

2. Compile the Info-Unzip library.  This is needed to compile and link
   the FreeDOS Install program.

   If you are using DOS and the Borland C Compiler 3.1 (or
   compatible), use the `Makefile.bc' in `LIB\UNZIP\MSDOS'

   If you are using a different platform, use the Makefile provided
   in the Info-Unzip sources to create the library.  (This works great
   under Linux.)

3. Go to the root of the source tree (the one that has the `DOC' and
   `SRC' and `LIB' directories in it)

4. Check the Makefile to make sure the path to the Info-Unzip library
   is correct.  For DOS, you will want to edit the file
   `SRC\MAKEFILE.BC'.

5. Compile the Install program.  If you are using DOS and the Borland
   C Compiler 3.1 (or compatible), type:

   make -f makefile.bc


   If you are using UNIX, type:

   make


6. You are done!

TO USE THE INSTALL PROGRAM:

Copy the `INSTALL.EXE', `INSTALL.DAT', and all the `.TXT' files to
where you will run the Install program.  Usually, this will be a boot
floppy.

For international support, also copy the files from nls/ to the
directory indicated by your NLSPATH env variable.  Your LANG env
variable should contain your language code.  (Could this contain an
easter egg?)
