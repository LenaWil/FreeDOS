   Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined
   by  the  extremely  function-key-rich keyboard of the AT&T
   7300, aka 3B1, aka Safari 4.   Modern  personal  computers
   usually  have  only a small subset of these.  IBM PC-style
   consoles  typically  support  little  more  than   KEY_UP,
   KEY_DOWN,    KEY_LEFT,   KEY_RIGHT,   KEY_HOME,   KEY_END,
   KEY_NPAGE, KEY_PPAGE, and function keys 1 through 12.  The
   Ins key is usually mapped to KEY_IC.
